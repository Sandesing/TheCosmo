                        I am Pablo Carmona, I'm 13, and I think that rugby is a sport that requires a lot of effort and dedication, it is a way to unburden yourself of how difficult life can be sometimes, a sport that demands a lot of respect.
I have been practicing for about 6 years and I have realized that it is a sport that anyone can practice but not everyone dares to practice it.

My favorite instrument is the piano, because was the first one that I played and also because it's a little bit difficult.

                <p> The school constitutes the central and primordial nucleus of education; both in the community and in
                    the family, therefore, its role as an institution is framed in two directions: one to form and the other
                    another to prepare, to achieve the integral formation of man for the society in which he is going to
                    develop. Education is an important engine of development and one of the most effective instruments
                    to reduce poverty and improve health, and achieve gender equality, peace and stability.

                <p>  I'm Dami√°n, form tenth grade Inspiratec and I really like maths because they help us to be more logical people, to have a more creative thinking. I am practicing maths since 6 years ago, because they help us to have a cognitive thinking more accurate and more developed than the other people.
